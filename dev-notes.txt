make a module to make it easier to put on web.
  * what is the minimum need to do a roll?
    * the "lowest" table is the terrain subtable
      * mountain->men
      * location needs associated terrain

can give a call with info like:
  {
    terrain   => mountain,
    sub-table => undead,
  }

  or
  {
    location   => Khromarium,
    terrain    => city,
  }

Then a roll on that table can be done

so maybe url route can be:

localhost/TERRAIN/TABLE
